== Releases
* 0.26 - not released
** Startup deployment scanning order changed to avoid a race condition where a property value may not have been loaded before the start of a consumer.

* 0.25
** Fix multithreading that didn't scale past two threads.
** Include bash in the alpine based docker container so work arounds aren't necessary to start the system.

* 0.24
** Synchronous producers

* 0.23
* 0.22
** Add retries to es indexing code for the retry and replay plugins.

* 0.21
** Ensure consumers connections are cleaned up correctly.

* 0.20
** Fix thread pool restart after a consumer receives a badly formed message.

* 0.18
** Acknowledge messages once forklift has obtained the message and begins processing it. This
corrects a bug that could cause a message to be processed twice in the event of a broker node failure.

* 0.17
** Add a separate thread to push replay logs to elastic search. This will allow msgs to be unhindered by the REST calls to ES.
** Cleanup old errors from previous indexes before indexing the new doc. This can be inefficient, but guarantees the msg id is only in the system once.

* 0.16
** Fix bug that causes the max retries exceeded prop to not show in replay logs.
** Fix bug that caused the retry startup search to fail due to having too many results.

* 0.15
** Elasticsearch implementation of retries and replay logs.

* 0.13
** Fix MultiThreaded consumer auto closing of resources.

* 0.12
** Auto closing of producers that are injected.

* 0.11
** Close jms sessions correctly to avoid open session buildup on the amq nodes.

* 0.10
** Added a new @Property annotation that injects message properties into the consumer
** Extended @Config and @Headers to allow you to inject specific headers and config fields
** The @On decorator now is repeatable; one method can now intercept multiple lifecycle events
** Override classloader to delegate to the JVM libraries in cases where libs that start with these packages ("java", "com.sun", "sun", "org.xml", "org.w3c").

* 0.9
** Removed Scala build dependencies.
** Added the ability to close the forklift producer to avoid memory leaks in client code.
** Added key/value pair send viathe forklift producer.
** Added a new On decorator that allows the lifecycle to be intercepted at any point by a method intercept.

* 0.8
** Remove spring completely from the core and replace with a service mechanism.

* 0.7
** Fix issue that would cause a consumer to stop processing due to a redelivery loop. This was caused any time a bad json parse occurred.

* 0.6
** Replay logger flush periodically if no messages are received. Helps guarantee nothing gets lost in the buffer.
** Log file configuration. Setup the container to drop a log file in /logs.
** Fix lost msgs that end up in the dead letter queue by using the core thread to process messages during a thread pool overload.
** Allow multiple Queue/Topic annotations per consumer. This helps when needing to monitor two different queues for fast vs slow processing.

* 0.5
** Spring setup fixes
** Main thread death fix when a consumer's spring context startup fails

* 0.4
** Allow the consul host to be specified
** Fix failover url construction when using service discovery with only one broker.

* 0.3
** Updates to docker container builds
** New arguments to allow retry/replay dirs to be set
** Allow two deployment directories to be scanned

* 0.2
** Fix for property file injection into consumer.

* 0.1
** Initial beta release
