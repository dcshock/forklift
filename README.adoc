== Components
Forklift is separated into individual libraries that make up the framework. forklift-server will bring
in all the necessary dependencies and plugins to use Forklift with ActiveMQ.

Forklift-Server::
Forklift packaged as a set of server based components that can be executed at runtime.

Forklift-Activemq::
A connector for ActiveMQ.

Forklift-Kafka::
A connector for Kafka.

Forklift-Stats::
A plugin for Forklift that collects stats for each message and places them
in properties for storage by other plugins.

Forklift-Retry::
A broker agnostic implementation of retries. Uses elastic search for storage.

Forklift-Replay::
A broker agnostic implementation of message replay logging. Uses elastic search for storage.
Kibana makes a great tool to view Forklift replay logs.

See the link:doc/PLUGINS.md[plugins documentation] for more information on how to install and use plugins.
